# Intro

Head on down to Groovebox Records where we have Melbourne’s finest selection of poly vinyl chloride.

Whether you’re into old school disco bangers, percussive world music or punchy bassy beats, our crates will be sure to have a slab of waxy goodness that’ll tickle your fancy.

Dig through creates whilst our resident disc jockeys play their weekly back to back slots from the 1s and 2s in the groove booth.

# Location

Groovebox Records is based at 120 Smith St and boasts 40 square metres of sheer musical joy.

> What I like most about Groovebox Records is the insane selection of stuff they’ve got. Releases you never knew about that direct your tastes into totally new realms.

— Jenny Craig

> I used to be so locked into only classic rock but then after a few visits to Groovebox Records and getting recommendations from Pete I’m suddenly listening to awesome 70s West African funk and Latin American sambas!
